When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

   Manually pulling allows only updating local with changes when it doesn't disrupt workflow. Would not want conflicting changes to break local copy. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forking is copying someone else's repo where I don't have permission to push to it. Forking is a feature specific to Github. It allows me to see whose repo I forked from and how many times that repo has been forked (as well as how many repos I have forked). Cloning is making a copy of a repo into my local environment. Branching occurs only within a repository. It is creating a separate flow where I can make commits to and eventually merge back to the master branch. It is for experimenting with new features.orking is copying someone else's repo where I don't have permission to push to it. Cloning is making a copy of a repo into my local environment.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    undo bad changes in local copy by referring to last known state of remote, also if do not want the new commit on remote, can take the locally stored version of remote and override.
