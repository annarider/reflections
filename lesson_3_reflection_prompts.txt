When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    when working with teams, multiple people contributing work 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

   Manually pulling allows only updating local with changes when it doesn't disrupt workflow. Would not want conflicting changes to break local copy. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forking is copying someone else's repo where I don't have permission to push to it. Forking is a feature specific to Github. It allows me to see whose repo I forked from and how many times that repo has been forked (as well as how many repos I have forked). Cloning is making a copy of a repo into my local environment. Branching occurs only within a repository. It is creating a separate flow where I can make commits to and eventually merge back to the master branch. It is for experimenting with new features.orking is copying someone else's repo where I don't have permission to push to it. Cloning is making a copy of a repo into my local environment.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    undo bad changes in local copy by referring to last known state of remote, also if do not want the new commit on remote, can take the locally stored version of remote and override.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

   Using Google Drive, Dropbox or another similar file sharing technology. What's easier: automatic syncing and commenting so making updates would be less manual work. Harder: not overriding my changings and potentially introducing bad changes but unable to recover. Also harder to do experiments because there's no branching feature. Probably less organized too by saving multiple copies of the same files to back up. 

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

   When creating an experimental feature or adding something new that is not fully tested and we don't want it to destroy good work on the master branch. Benefit of directly committing to master branch is no manual work to go through merging into another branch and back into master. But branching is good feature for version control and collaboration. Ensures code is not switched out from underneath.
